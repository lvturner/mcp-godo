# Feature Specification: Project Table for Todo Items

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-table`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We want to create a 'project' table that allows us to group todo items by 'project' we should also update the existing MCP methods/functions to support the new tables, as well as creating new MCP method/functions to manage CRUD operations for the 'project' table. Todo items should be able to exist and be created without specifying a project (i.e. the associated project should be optional)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Manage Projects (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create and manage projects so that I can group my todo items by context or category.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature and enables the main use case of organizing todos.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a project, viewing it, and verifying it appears in the project list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an LLM agent is processing a request to create a project, **When** the agent calls the "create_project" MCP method, **Then** a new project should be created and returned with the project details
2. **Given** an LLM agent has provided project details, **When** the agent calls the "create_project" MCP method, **Then** the project should be created and visible in the project list

### User Story 2 - Assign Todos to Projects (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to assign todo items to projects so that I can organize my tasks by context.

**Why this priority**: This enables the main organizational functionality of the feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a todo item and assigning it to a project, then verifying it appears in the project's todo list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an LLM agent is processing a request to assign a todo to a project, **When** the agent calls the "assign_todo_to_project" MCP method, **Then** the todo item should be associated with that project
2. **Given** an LLM agent is viewing a project, **When** the agent calls the "get_project_todos" MCP method, **Then** all todos assigned to that project should be returned

---

### User Story 3 - Create Todos Without Projects (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to create todo items without specifying a project so that I can quickly add tasks without the overhead of project assignment.

**Why this priority**: This provides flexibility for users who don't want to organize everything into projects.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a todo item without selecting a project, then verifying it appears in a default "unassigned" or "no project" view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an LLM agent is processing a request to create a todo without a project, **When** the agent calls the "create_todo" MCP method without a project_id parameter, **Then** the todo should be created successfully
2. **Given** an LLM agent has created a todo without a project, **When** the agent calls the "get_todos" MCP method, **Then** the todo should appear in a default unassigned view

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a project is deleted? How are todos assigned to that project handled?
- How does system handle when a todo item is assigned to a project that no longer exists?
- What happens when a user tries to create a project with a duplicate name?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST create a new `projects` table with fields for project ID, name, description, and creation timestamp
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create new projects with a name and optional description
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to view a list of all projects
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to update project details (name and description)
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete projects (with appropriate confirmation)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to assign todo items to projects (optional assignment)
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to create todo items without specifying a project
- **FR-008**: System MUST support querying todos by project ID
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle the case where a project is deleted by either removing the association or moving todos to a default project
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that project names are unique within the system

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Project**: Represents a grouping of todo items. Key attributes: ID (primary key), name (unique), description, created_at timestamp
- **Todo Item**: Represents a task. Key attributes: ID (primary key), title, description, project_id (foreign key, optional), created_at timestamp

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create a new project in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: System supports 1000 concurrent users managing projects and todos
- **SC-003**: 95% of users can successfully assign a todo item to a project on first attempt
- **SC-004**: 90% of users can create a todo item without specifying a project on first attempt
- **SC-005**: System handles project deletion gracefully without data loss
