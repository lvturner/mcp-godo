# Research Findings for Project Table Feature

## Decision: MCP Framework Integration Details
**Rationale:** The existing MCP framework needs to be extended to support project table functionality. Based on the current codebase structure, we need to understand how to properly add new methods to the existing MCP server.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Direct method addition to existing server struct
- Creating new handler modules
- Using middleware approach

## Decision: Database Schema Design
**Rationale:** The database schema needs to support projects and their relationship with todos. Based on the existing codebase patterns, we should follow the established schema design principles.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Single table with project_id foreign key
- Separate projects table with relationships
- Embedded approach in todos table

## Decision: Performance Optimization
**Rationale:** To achieve <200ms response time with 1000 concurrent users, we need to implement efficient database queries and caching strategies.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Caching layer implementation

## Decision: Error Handling and Validation
**Rationale:** Proper error handling and validation are critical for a robust implementation. We should follow the existing patterns in the codebase.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Standard Go error handling
- Custom error types
- Validation libraries

## Decision: Testing Strategy
**Rationale:** Testing with testify framework should follow the existing patterns in the codebase for consistency.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Unit testing approach
- Integration testing approach
- Mocking strategies

## Decision: Existing Codebase Patterns
**Rationale:** Integration with current codebase conventions ensures maintainability and consistency.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Following existing struct patterns
- Using established naming conventions
- Adhering to current code organization
