# Research: Category Feature Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Feature**: Category Feature for Todo Items  
**Status**: Complete

## Technology Decisions

### Database Design Patterns
**Decision**: Follow the same database design patterns as the existing project feature  
**Rationale**: The project feature provides a proven template for implementing similar functionality. Both features require CRUD operations, unique name validation, and optional associations with todo items.  
**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Different table structure - rejected to maintain consistency
- Different indexing strategy - rejected as current approach is optimal

### Entity Structure
**Decision**: Mirror the Project entity structure with category-specific additions  
**Rationale**: The Project entity has proven successful with proper NULL handling, timestamp management, and JSON serialization. Adding color support for categories provides visual organization benefits.  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simplified entity without timestamps - rejected as timestamps are valuable for audit trails
- No color support - rejected as it provides significant UX value for visual organization

### Database Support
**Decision**: Implement both SQLite and MariaDB support following existing patterns  
**Rationale**: The application already supports both databases with proven migration and implementation patterns. Maintaining dual support ensures flexibility for different deployment scenarios.  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- SQLite only - rejected as MariaDB support is already established
- MariaDB only - rejected as SQLite is valuable for development and lightweight deployments

### MCP Handler Patterns
**Decision**: Follow the established MCP handler patterns from project handlers  
**Rationale**: The project handlers demonstrate proper error handling, argument validation, and response formatting that aligns with MCP protocol requirements.  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Different validation approach - rejected as current pattern is comprehensive
- Different response format - rejected as consistency with existing handlers is important

### Migration Strategy
**Decision**: Use separate migration files for category table and todo updates  
**Rationale**: Following the project's migration pattern (0003 for projects table, 0004 for todo updates) provides clear versioning and rollback capabilities.  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single migration file - rejected as it complicates rollback scenarios
- Different numbering scheme - rejected as consistency with existing migrations is important

## Implementation Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Use descriptive error messages that help identify the specific issue
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes through MCP protocol
- Handle database errors gracefully with proper user feedback

### Validation
- Validate required fields (category name) before database operations
- Ensure unique category names at the database level with proper constraints
- Handle optional fields (description, color) with proper NULL handling

### Database Operations
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper transaction handling for data consistency
- Add appropriate indexes for performance optimization

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual service methods
- Integration tests for database operations
- Contract tests for MCP method validation

## Edge Case Handling

### Category Deletion
**Decision**: Implement soft delete or cascade handling based on business requirements  
**Rationale**: Need to determine whether to preserve historical data or allow complete removal. Reference from spec mentions handling todos assigned to deleted categories.

### Duplicate Category Names
**Decision**: Enforce unique constraint at database level with proper error handling  
**Rationale**: Prevents data integrity issues and provides clear user feedback when attempting to create duplicate categories.

### Todo-Category Association
**Decision**: Allow optional category assignment with proper NULL handling  
**Rationale**: Maintains flexibility for users who don't want to categorize all todos, as specified in the requirements.

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexing
- Index on category name for fast lookups
- Index on category_id in todos table for efficient queries
- Consider composite indexes if complex queries are needed

### Query Optimization
- Use JOIN operations efficiently when fetching todos with category information
- Implement pagination for large category lists
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs before database operations
- Validate data types and formats
- Implement proper length limits for text fields

### Access Control
- Consider whether categories should be user-specific in multi-user scenarios
- Implement appropriate authorization checks for category operations

## Conclusion

The category feature should follow the established patterns from the project feature while adding category-specific functionality like color support. The implementation should maintain consistency with existing code structure, error handling, and database patterns to ensure maintainability and reliability.
