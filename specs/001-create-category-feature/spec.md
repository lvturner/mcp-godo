# Feature Specification: Category Feature for Todo Items

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-category-feature`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a category feature, that allows Todo list items to optionally be linked to a category, the user should also be able to use crud operations to manipulate categories"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Manage Categories (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create and manage categories so that I can organize my todo items by type or theme.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature and enables the main use case of categorizing todos.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a category, viewing it, and verifying it appears in the category list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an LLM agent is processing a request to create a category, **When** the agent calls the "create_category" MCP method, **Then** a new category should be created and returned with the category details
2. **Given** an LLM agent has provided category details, **When** the agent calls the "create_category" MCP method, **Then** the category should be created and visible in the category list

### User Story 2 - Assign Todos to Categories (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to assign todo items to categories so that I can organize my tasks by type or theme.

**Why this priority**: This enables the main organizational functionality of the feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a todo item and assigning it to a category, then verifying it appears in the category's todo list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an LLM agent is processing a request to assign a todo to a category, **When** the agent calls the "assign_todo_to_category" MCP method, **Then** the todo item should be associated with that category
2. **Given** an LLM agent is viewing a category, **When** the agent calls the "get_category_todos" MCP method, **Then** all todos assigned to that category should be returned

---

### User Story 3 - Create Todos Without Categories (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to create todo items without specifying a category so that I can quickly add tasks without the overhead of category assignment.

**Why this priority**: This provides flexibility for users who don't want to organize everything into categories.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a todo item without selecting a category, then verifying it appears in a default "uncategorized" or "no category" view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an LLM agent is processing a request to create a todo without a category, **When** the agent calls the "create_todo" MCP method without a category_id parameter, **Then** the todo should be created successfully
2. **Given** an LLM agent has created a todo without a category, **When** the agent calls the "get_todos" MCP method, **Then** the todo should appear in a default uncategorized view

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a category is deleted? How are todos assigned to that category handled?
- How does system handle when a todo item is assigned to a category that no longer exists?
- What happens when a user tries to create a category with a duplicate name?
- Can a todo item be assigned to multiple categories?
- What happens if a user tries to assign a todo to both a project and a category?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST create a new `categories` table with fields for category ID, name, description, color, and creation timestamp
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create new categories with a name, optional description, and optional color
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to view a list of all categories
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to update category details (name, description, and color)
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete categories (with appropriate confirmation)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to assign todo items to categories (optional assignment)
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to create todo items without specifying a category
- **FR-008**: System MUST support querying todos by category ID
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle the case where a category is deleted by either removing the association or moving todos to a default category
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that category names are unique within the system
- **FR-011**: System MUST support optional color coding for categories for visual organization
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to remove a todo item from a category

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Category**: Represents a grouping of todo items by type or theme. Key attributes: ID (primary key), name (unique), description, color (optional), created_at timestamp
- **Todo Item**: Represents a task. Key attributes: ID (primary key), title, description, project_id (foreign key, optional), category_id (foreign key, optional), created_at timestamp

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

- **SC-001**: Users can create a new category in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: System supports 1000 concurrent users managing categories and todos
- **SC-003**: 95% of users can successfully assign a todo item to a category on first attempt
- **SC-004**: 90% of users can create a todo item without specifying a category on first attempt
- **SC-005**: System handles category deletion gracefully without data loss
- **SC-006**: 85% of users can successfully update category details on first attempt
