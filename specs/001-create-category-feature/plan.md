# Implementation Plan: Category Feature for Todo Items

**Branch**: `001-create-category-feature` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [specs/001-create-category-feature/spec.md](specs/001-create-category-feature/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-category-feature/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a category feature that allows Todo list items to optionally be linked to a category, with full CRUD operations for category management. Users should be able to organize their todo items by type or theme using categories, while maintaining the ability to create todos without categories. The implementation follows established patterns from the existing project feature, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.24.2  
**Primary Dependencies**: github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go (MCP framework), github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 (SQLite driver), github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql (MySQL driver)  
**Storage**: SQLite (primary), MariaDB (secondary support)  
**Testing**: Go standard testing package with testify for assertions  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (MCP server implementation)  
**Project Type**: Single project (MCP server)  
**Performance Goals**: Support 1000 concurrent users, <200ms response time for CRUD operations  
**Constraints**: Must maintain compatibility with existing todo functionality, optional category assignment  
**Scale/Scope**: Small to medium scale - supporting individual users and small teams

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the project constitution, this feature aligns with:
- **User-Centric Design**: Provides intuitive category organization for better todo management
- **Reliability and Stability**: Builds on existing stable todo infrastructure
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains referential integrity between todos and categories
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle growing numbers of categories and todos
- **Security**: Follows existing security patterns for data validation and sanitization
- **Documentation Excellence**: Comprehensive documentation will be maintained
- **Sustainable Development**: Follows established patterns and conventions

```

**Structure Decision**: Following the existing single project structure used for the MCP server, with clear separation between domain logic (pkg/todo), handlers (pkg/handler), and database implementations.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | All requirements align with constitution principles | N/A |

## Planning Completion Summary

✅ **Phase 0 Complete**: Technical context established, constitution check passed, research completed
- Analyzed existing project feature patterns and best practices
- Documented technology decisions and implementation approach
- Identified key considerations for database design, error handling, and performance

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Design artifacts generated
- **data-model.md**: Comprehensive entity definitions, database schema, relationships, and business rules
- **contracts/mcp-tools-plan.md**: 9 MCP tools defined with parameters, examples, and error handling
- **quickstart.md**: User-friendly guide with examples, workflows, and best practices
- **Agent context updated**: Technology stack and project details added to agent context

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Pattern Consistency**: Follows established project feature patterns for maintainability
2. **Database Support**: Dual SQLite/MariaDB support following existing implementation
3. **Optional Categorization**: Todos can exist without categories for flexibility
4. **Color Support**: Added color field for visual organization capabilities
5. **MCP Tool Coverage**: 9 comprehensive tools covering all CRUD operations and category-todo relationships

## Next Steps

The planning phase is complete. The implementation can proceed with:
1. Database migrations creation
2. Category service implementation
3. MCP handler implementation
4. Testing and validation

All design artifacts are ready for the development phase.
