## Constitutional Framework

This constitution serves as the foundational document for all governance decisions and operational procedures within the MCP Todo List Server project. All participants are expected to adhere to its principles and guidelines.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity**: The project prioritizes clean, straightforward implementations that are easy to understand and maintain. We avoid unnecessary complexity and favor simple solutions to problems.

2. **Test-First Development**: All code changes must include comprehensive unit and integration tests. We write tests before implementing features to ensure quality and prevent regressions.

3. **Library-First Approach**: The project is designed to be a reusable library that can be easily integrated into other applications, rather than a monolithic application.

4. **CLI Interface**: The project provides a command-line interface for easy interaction and automation capabilities.

5. **Observability**: The system includes comprehensive logging, metrics, and monitoring to ensure transparency and ease of debugging.

6. **Versioning**: The project follows semantic versioning to clearly communicate changes and maintain backward compatibility where possible.

7. **Integration Testing**: The project includes integration tests to verify that components work together correctly in realistic scenarios.

8. **Clean Architecture**: The codebase follows clean architecture principles to separate business logic from infrastructure concerns and ensure maintainability.

9. **Database Schema Evolution**: The project implements a robust migration system to manage database schema changes safely and consistently.

10. **Minimal Dependencies**: The project keeps dependencies to a minimum to reduce complexity, security risks, and potential compatibility issues.

## Section 1: Project Overview and Purpose

The MCP Todo List Server is a simple, lightweight server that provides basic todo list functionality through an MCP interface. It is written in Go and designed for learning purposes while fitting personal workflows. The server stores todos in a SQLite database and exposes a set of tools for managing todo items.

## Section 2: Governance Structure and Roles

The MCP Todo List Server project is governed by a core team of maintainers who are responsible for making decisions about the project's direction and ensuring its quality. The governance structure includes:

- **Maintainers**: Core contributors who have the authority to make decisions about the project's direction and code changes.
- **Contributors**: Community members who contribute code, documentation, or other improvements to the project.
- **Community Members**: Users of the project who provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Section 3: Development Process and Standards

The development process for the MCP Todo List Server follows these standards:

- All code must be written in Go, following idiomatic Go practices.
- Code reviews are required for all pull requests before merging.
- All new features must include appropriate unit and integration tests.
- Documentation must be updated when new features are added.
- Code must be formatted using gofmt and linted with golint.
- The project follows a test-first development approach.

## Section 4: Release Management and Versioning

The MCP Todo List Server follows semantic versioning (SemVer) for all releases. The versioning strategy includes:

- Major versions (X.0.0) for incompatible API changes
- Minor versions (0.X.0) for backward-compatible new features
- Patch versions (0.0.X) for backward-compatible bug fixes

Release candidates are created before major releases, and all changes are documented in the changelog.

## Section 5: Community and Contribution Guidelines

The MCP Todo List Server welcomes contributions from the community. Contributors are expected to:

- Follow the code of conduct
- Submit pull requests with clear descriptions of changes
- Ensure tests pass before submitting code
- Follow the project's coding standards
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions

## Section 6: Conflict Resolution and Decision Making

In case of conflicts within the project, the following process is used:

1. Discussion in the appropriate channels (GitHub issues, pull requests, etc.)
2. If discussion doesn't resolve the issue, maintainers will make a decision
3. Decisions are made with the best interests of the project and community in mind

## Section 7: Intellectual Property and Licensing

The MCP Todo List Server is licensed under the MIT License. All contributions to the project must be made under the same license. The project does not claim ownership of any contributions beyond the original code.

## Section 8: Security and Privacy

The MCP Todo List Server takes security and privacy seriously:

- All data is stored locally in a SQLite database
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- The project follows secure coding practices
- Regular security reviews are conducted

## Section 9: Documentation and Communication

The project maintains comprehensive documentation that includes:

- API documentation
- User guides
- Developer documentation
- Contribution guidelines

Communication occurs primarily through GitHub issues and pull requests.

## Section 10: Project Maintenance and Support

The project is maintained by the core team with community support. Maintenance includes:

- Regular bug fixes
- Security updates
- Feature enhancements
- Documentation updates

Support is provided through GitHub issues and community discussions.
