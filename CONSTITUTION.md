## Constitutional Framework

This constitution serves as the foundational document for all governance decisions and operational procedures within the MCP Todo List Server project. All participants are expected to adhere to its principles and guidelines.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity**: The system shall be designed with minimal complexity to ensure maintainability and ease of use.
2. **Test-First Development**: All code shall be developed with comprehensive unit and integration tests.
3. **Library-First Approach**: Core functionality shall be implemented as reusable libraries before creating command-line tools.
4. **CLI Interface**: The system shall provide a command-line interface for all operations.
5. **Observability**: The system shall provide comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.
6. **Versioning**: The system shall follow semantic versioning for all releases.
7. **Integration Testing**: The system shall include integration tests for all major functionality.
8. **Clean Architecture**: The system shall follow clean architecture principles to separate concerns.
9. **Database Schema Evolution**: The system shall support database schema evolution through migrations.
10. **Minimal Dependencies**: The system shall minimize external dependencies to reduce maintenance burden.

## Section 1: Project Overview and Purpose

The MCP Todo List Server is a simple, lightweight server that provides basic todo list functionality through an MCP interface. It is written in Go and designed for learning purposes while fitting personal workflows. The server stores todos in a SQLite database and exposes a set of tools for managing todo items.

## Section 2: Governance Structure and Roles

The MCP Todo List Server project is governed by a core team of maintainers who are responsible for making decisions about the project's direction and ensuring its quality. The governance structure includes:

- **Maintainers**: Core contributors who have the authority to make decisions about the project's direction and code changes.
- **Contributors**: Community members who contribute code, documentation, or other improvements to the project.
- **Community Members**: Users of the project who provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Section 3: Development Process and Standards

The development process for the MCP Todo List Server follows these standards:

- All code must be written in Go, following idiomatic Go practices.
- Code reviews are required for all pull requests before merging.
- All new features must include appropriate unit and integration tests.
- Documentation must be updated when new features are added.
- Code must be formatted using gofmt and linted with golint.
- The project follows a test-first development approach.

## Section 4: Release Management and Versioning

The MCP Todo List Server follows semantic versioning (SemVer) for all releases. The versioning strategy includes:

- Major versions (X.0.0) for incompatible API changes
- Minor versions (0.X.0) for backward-compatible new features
- Patch versions (0.0.X) for backward-compatible bug fixes

Release candidates are created before major releases, and all changes are documented in the changelog.

## Section 5: Community and Contribution Guidelines

The MCP Todo List Server welcomes contributions from the community. Contributors are expected to:

- Follow the code of conduct
- Submit pull requests with clear descriptions of changes
- Ensure tests pass before submitting code
- Follow the project's coding standards
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions

## Section 6: Conflict Resolution and Decision Making

In case of conflicts within the project, the following process is used:

1. Discussion in the appropriate channels (GitHub issues, pull requests, etc.)
2. If discussion doesn't resolve the issue, maintainers will make a decision
3. Decisions are made with the best interests of the project and community in mind
